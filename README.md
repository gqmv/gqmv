Computer Science student at the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/).
My motto is: Sometimes you're so eager to get to the top of the mountain that you don't even realise that there was an elevator right behind you. (Basically means: always plan your approach before trying to solve a problem.)
